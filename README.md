current project status. 
IQ - tried mulitple RNN architecures (aribitary serched only for models <30Mb) the best results achived 
is MSE(out)/MSE(in) ~ 0.6 . moved on to spectogram learning with CNN impleminting somthing similear to https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8683423 . 
FCO - seems to be preety easy to estimate using a NN (avraging the predictions has more samples are buffered ) 
impedance impairments - hasnt touched.
